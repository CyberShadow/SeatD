[12:47:32] <maxter> kate crashes when disabling and then re-enabling the plugin
[12:48:13] <maxter> disable - close the dialog - open the dialog - enable - crash
- probably runtime re-init

- form docs to 80cols

- pagedown/up in search field should propagate to listview
- add own user/directory configs?
- kate-modelines are not optimal for include paths, because the file has to be opened in kate

- have way to visualize running parser (sidebar icon blinking?)

- list isn't cleared when switching documents (maybe don't remove, since once dirty-stuff works, it will be repopulated anyway)
- reparse on open
- mark module as dirty on buffer change
- optionally auto-hide seatd sidebar for unsupported files
- pass correct tab width to parser
- make tree-view configurable

- regex-based compiler error message parser

- depending on whether the selection was done from end to start or from start to end, duplicate extends the selection or not
- esc in list does not defocus
- select-first does not always work correctly

- add open file list to live search (jump to build.sh etc.) (integrate document list into S4K?)
- space separated searches treats as AND "tan mat cos" -> tango.math.Math.cos
- optionally add document changes and Kate's normal search to the history
- command to show decl of expression in hint-popup
- sort decl list by distance to cursor (only after substring input?)
- tree-view browser of all packages/modules/declarations
