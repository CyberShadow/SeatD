Package

- create complete types for declarations
- determine type of expression
- determine top-level expression from cursor pos (instead of word under cursor)

- reparse on explicit request (separate from list-shortcuts)
- reparse on modification (how to determine modification in kate?)
- note include path change - try to reparse empty modules on change

- support ddoc comments - separate DDoc grammar

- allow multiple parsers

- parse in separate threads
- abort parser
- command to force cache flush
- how to deal with multiple buffers' include paths (ambiguities)
- have way to visualize running parser (sidebar icon blinking?)

- function overloads not displayed
- function not listed if statement within it is incomplete:
    void gotoPrevious()
    {
        if ( 
    }
- recovery doesn't work as expected:
decl1
garbage
decl2
garbage
decl3
=> decl2 missing

- have options for detail level (decls under functions, under statements, a.s.o.)
- have a all-parsed-decl's list (how does it perform?)
- give list of all matches (if multiple) on "goto decl"
- start/end line for each node (find current scope node with these)
- imports can have a parent decl
- conditionaldecl vs. conditionalstatement

- auto-completion
- allow expression.ident in findDecl
- consider function signature in findDeclaration
- findDecl doesn't handle module-search correctly - might have non-module decl with same name

- deal with __EOF__ 0x00 0x1A
- deal with # line
- uniAlphas
- add vertical tab 0xb and form feed 0xc to whitespace
- parsing glparser.d with recovery template takes forever

- optionally display parser errors in ouput
- cache ASG on disk
- search for dmd/gdc, read sc.ini
- optionally reparse on external change
