Prerequisites:
- Kate 3.5
- KDE3 devel package
- GDC
- Tango 0.99.4 sources
- Rebuild (from DSSS package)

Step 1 - build the Tango runtime with Position Independent Code (PIC), s.t. it can be used in a dynamically loaded library (or shared object)

- Get the patch http://dsource.org/projects/tango/attachment/ticket/857/tango-0.99.4_dynload2.patch?format=raw
- apply it in the tango base directory
- goto tango/lib
- execute the following:
export DFLAGS=-fPIC
export CFLAGS=-fPIC
./build-gdc.sh
./install-gdc.sh --uninstall
./install-gdc.sh

Step 2 - build the plugin

- checkout SEATD
svn co https://svn.mainia.de/svn/SEATD/trunk
- goto src/kate
- try running build.sh
- here you will probably have to adjust paths etc.
- the build.sh already copies the plugin files to you home directory. if everything worked, you can run Kate and activate the plugin in the settings.
