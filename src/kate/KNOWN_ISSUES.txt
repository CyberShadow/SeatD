SEATD for Kate - Known Issues
=====================================================================

- SEATD leaks like crazy, because the GC is disabled. The GC does not work with dynamically loaded modules on Linux, yet. Rely on your system to swap out unused memory or restart Kate every now and then.

- Opening and switching documents may be slow than usual, espescially when opening/switching to a document for the first time during a session. This is because parsing isn't done in background, yet. SEATD for Kate will have to parse the file, all it's dependencies and it's dependencies' dependencies...

- Setting include paths using Kate modelines will only work if the file is actually opened. A way to set include paths once for a whole project directory is still to be implemented.

- SEATD prints error messages to stdout. It'll need a better logging facility for that.

- Function local declarations are collected only from the first nesting level. Declarations that reside e.g. in a loop body will not be listed.

- SEATD will parse anything you edit, not just D files. The results are mostly useless for non-D files.
