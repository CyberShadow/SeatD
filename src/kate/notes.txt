- select-first does not always work correctly
- have a all-parsed-decl's list (how does it perform?)
- make tree-view configurable
- kate-modelines are not optimal for include paths, because the file has to be opened in kate
- add open file list to live search (jump to build.sh etc.) (integrate document list into S4K?)
- add KatePart extension from within Kate plugin? add missing editing functions
- spoace separated searches treats as AND "tan mat cos" -> tango.math.Math.cos

- function not listed if statement within it is incomplete:
    void gotoPrevious()
    {
        if ( 
    }
